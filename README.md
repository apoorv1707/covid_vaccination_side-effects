# covid_vaccination_side-effects
This project analyzes the relationships between the various adverse effects and the factors causing the adverse effects in relation to the Covid-19 Vaccine. 
The goal is to identify the relationships between COVID-19 vaccines and its adverse effects in order to provide safe vaccines to individuals. 
We noticed through data analysis that elderly people experienced severe side effects. 
We were able to predict who was at risk of experiencing severe side effects based on age, gender, vaccine manufacturer, and medical history. 
This analysis could provide appropriate information to health care professionals about the factors to be considered while the administration of different types of vaccines for each individual.
